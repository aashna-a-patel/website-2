# Ask ChatGPT to create a cool-looking plot
# Prompt: "Hey ChatGPT, can you create a cool-looking plot using the billboard tibble from tidyr and ggplot()? I'd like it to show something interesting like how songs move up and down the Billboard chart over time."

# Example Plot:
# We'll plot the chart position over time for the top 5 songs with the longest chart runs

# Reshape the data to long format
billboard_long <- billboard %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"),

  ) %>%

# Get the top 5 songs with the most weeks on the chart
